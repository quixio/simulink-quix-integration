# Simulink Starter Transformation

Quix enables developers to bring **Simulink models** into real-time streaming pipelines.  
This project demonstrates how to compile a Simulink model into a Python-compatible wheel (`.whl`) package and run it inside Quix, consuming input data from Kafka topics and publishing outputs back.

---

## Why This Project?

Simulink is widely used for modeling dynamic systems, but deploying these models into streaming environments can be challenging.  
With this starter transformation you can:

- Wrap a Simulink model as a MATLAB function
- Compile it into a `.whl` Python package
- Deploy it to Quix to process live streaming data

---

## Available Examples

Two examples are provided to guide through the whole process:

1. **[Simple angle rotation](https://github.com/quixio/simulink-quix-integration/tree/Main/simulink-wheel)**

2. **More complex combustion engine**
